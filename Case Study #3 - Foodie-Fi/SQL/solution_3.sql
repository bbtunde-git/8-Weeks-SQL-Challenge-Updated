-- A. Customer Journey

-- 1. Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the `subscriptions` table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
-- Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!
-- Non-SQL question, answered in Solution.md

-- B. Data Analysis Questions
-- 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

      COUNT(distinct customer_id) AS total_number_of_customers

-- C. Challenge Payment Question

/* --------------------
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new `payments` table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the `subscriptions` table with the following requirements:

- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original `start_date` of any monthly paid plan
- 
- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- 
- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- 
- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

-- 2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?

-- Non-SQL question

-- 3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?

-- Non-SQL question

-- 4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?

-- Non-SQL question

-- 5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
